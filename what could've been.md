Act 1: New Beginnings
---------------------

### Scene 1: Transfer Day

The protagonist arrives at Sakuragaoka High School mid-semester. During the principal's introduction tour, they pass the music room where Shion is playing a hauntingly beautiful melody on the piano/creating an intricate artwork. The protagonist pauses, captivated by the performance/creation. Their eyes meet briefly through the window before the principal gently urges them to continue. This wordless first encounter leaves a lasting impression, with the music/art serving as a motif throughout their relationship.

### Scene 2: Silent Integration

The protagonist's class introduction is deliberately minimal at their own request. They quietly take their assigned seat as curious whispers circulate. Rather than immediate friendship, the scene establishes the protagonist's carefully constructed social boundaries – polite but distant. During a challenging group assignment, the protagonist's insightful contribution catches both Kaito's attention and, from across the room, Shion's quiet notice. This establishes the protagonist not through standard social integration but through the glimpses of depth they occasionally, almost accidentally, reveal.

### Scene 3: Exploring the School

Kaito gives the protagonist a tour, explaining the upcoming Cultural Festival (three months away) as the school's biggest event. They pass by various club rooms, establishing the two main club options: Arts Club (where Shion is a star member) and Sports Club (where Kaito belongs).

### Scene 4: Dual Lives

The protagonist enters their apartment to find multiple pill organizers meticulously arranged on the counter and medical equipment quietly humming in the adjacent room. They begin their evening routine with practiced efficiency – checking vital sign logs, preparing specialized meals, and organizing medication schedules. A brief conversation through the partially open bedroom door reveals the duality of their existence: confident student by day, solitary caregiver by night. Their parent insists they shouldn't sacrifice their youth to caregiving, while the protagonist silently accepts this responsibility as simply part of who they are. This scene establishes the invisible weight they carry and why forming attachments at school feels both precious and frightening.

Act 2: Growing Connections
--------------------------

### Scene 5: Club Selection Day

**CHOICE POINT**: Which club will the protagonist join?

#### Path A: Arts Club

*   The protagonist joins the Arts Club, allowing direct interaction with Shion
    
*   They work together on various projects, gradually becoming closer
    
*   The protagonist learns about Shion's passion and talent
    
*   Club president Akira becomes a mentor figure to both
    

#### Path B: Sports Club

*   The protagonist joins the Sports Club with Kaito
    
*   They see Shion less frequently but their encounters become more meaningful
    
*   Occasional joint club activities create opportunities for interaction
    
*   Their relationship develops more slowly but with greater anticipation
    

### Scene 6: Academic Partnership

Regardless of club choice, the protagonist and Shion are paired for an important class project. This forces them to spend time together, deepening their connection. During study sessions, the protagonist learns about Shion's family expectations and artistic dreams.

### Scene 7: The Abandoned Observatory

During a conversation about finding space for creative expression, Shion hesitantly reveals their discovery – an abandoned astronomical observatory on the school's rooftop, officially closed but accessible through a maintenance stairwell. The space, with its panoramic glass dome and forgotten equipment, has become Shion's private studio. This trust in sharing something forbidden yet meaningful deepens their connection. Among the star charts and dust-covered telescopes, Shion confides about feeling caught between artistic passion and familial obligation.

### Scene 8: Sudden Absence

During preparations for a joint club exhibition, the protagonist's phone screen illuminates with a coded text message – their established emergency signal from home. Without explanation, they must immediately leave, abandoning hours of collaborative work with Shion at a critical moment. The protagonist's sudden departure creates confusion and hurt, especially as they remain deliberately vague about the reasons upon their return. This establishes the pattern of the protagonist's mysterious personal life creating unpredictable barriers in their relationship.

### Scene 9: Making Amends

The protagonist apologizes for their sudden disappearance, vaguely explaining the situation without details. Shion is understanding, and their relationship deepens as they share more personal stories. The foundation of romance begins to form.

Act 3: Deepening Bonds and Complications
----------------------------------------

### Scene 10: Festival Planning

Preparation for the Cultural Festival begins, creating natural opportunities for the protagonist and Shion to work together. Their growing attraction becomes evident to others, with friends making teasing comments. The festival serves as a countdown to a potential confession.

### Scene 11: The Revelation

During a private moment, Shion reveals to the protagonist the scholarship opportunity abroad – a chance to study art/music at a prestigious institution after graduation. However, accepting would mean leaving Japan for several years. Shion hasn't told their parents about this opportunity yet, fearing disapproval.

**MAJOR CHOICE POINT**: How does the protagonist respond?

*   Enthusiastically encourage Shion to pursue the scholarship
    
*   Express sadness about potential separation while being supportive
    
*   Subtly discourage the idea by emphasizing what Shion would miss in Japan
    

### Scene 12: The Unexpected Connection

During a collaborative project between clubs, the protagonist discovers something unexpected – Mio Sato, a charming exchange student recently returned from abroad, shares a complex history with Shion. Rather than being merely childhood friends, they were once co-creators of an award-winning artistic project that gained significant recognition. Their creative chemistry is immediately visible as they fall back into familiar patterns of collaboration, finishing each other's sentences and communicating through half-spoken artistic shorthand developed over years. The protagonist witnesses not simply friendship but an intellectual and creative partnership with depths they cannot access, creating a profound sense of being an outsider to a part of Shion's identity.

### Scene 13: Unspoken Feelings

Tensions rise as the protagonist observes Shion and Mio's easy familiarity. A conversation with Kaito or Yuki (depending on club choice) helps the protagonist recognize their romantic feelings for Shion. Meanwhile, hints suggest Mio harbors feelings for Shion.

### Scene 14: Parent-Teacher Conference

Shion's parents attend a school meeting where Akira praises their artistic talents. Depending on earlier choices, this either:

*   Leads to a family argument about Shion's future (if Haru encouraged the scholarship)
    
*   Creates tentative family openness to artistic pursuits (if Haru emphasized balance)
    
*   Reinforces their desire for Shion to pursue a "practical" career (if Haru discouraged)
    

### Scene 15: Health Deterioration

The protagonist's parent's condition worsens, requiring more of the protagonist's time and attention. This creates distance from school activities and Shion, just as their relationship was deepening. The protagonist must balance caretaking responsibilities with personal desires.

Act 4: Climax and Resolution
----------------------------

### Scene 16: Festival Eve

The day before the Cultural Festival, final preparations are underway. Tension builds as the protagonist plans to confess their feelings to Shion during the festival. Mio also appears determined to have an important conversation with Shion.

### Scene 17: The Deadline

Shion reveals the scholarship application deadline is the day after the festival, adding urgency to all relationships and decisions. Shion still hasn't fully decided whether to apply, torn between dreams and connections.

### Scene 18: Festival Morning

The Cultural Festival begins with excitement. The protagonist and Shion have brief, meaningful eye contact across the crowded school. Their respective club responsibilities keep them busy but anticipating a promised meeting later.

### Scene 19: The Alarm

Minutes before the planned meeting with Shion, the protagonist's specialized medical alert app activates with urgent warnings – their parent's remote monitoring system has detected dangerous vital sign fluctuations requiring immediate intervention. The screen displays a countdown: medical emergency services will automatically be dispatched in fifteen minutes unless the alert is manually managed. Only the protagonist knows the proper response protocols that might prevent an unnecessary and financially devastating hospital admission.

**CRITICAL CHOICE POINT**: What does the protagonist do?

#### Path A: Family First

*   The protagonist leaves immediately without seeing Shion
    
*   Unable to explain the sudden departure, creating misunderstanding
    
*   Mio uses this opportunity to grow closer to Shion
    

#### Path B: Desperate Explanation

*   The protagonist finds Shion first to briefly explain before leaving
    
*   Creates understanding but doesn't allow for confession
    
*   The moment passes but connection remains
    

#### Path C: Impossible Choice

*   The protagonist stays for the confession despite family emergency
    
*   Creates immediate happiness but long-term complications
    
*   Results in guilt that shadows the relationship
    

### Scene 20: Hospital Aftermath

The protagonist spends days at the hospital with their parent. During this time, the scholarship deadline passes. What happens depends on earlier choices and the critical choice:

#### Path A: Distance Grows

*   Shion, hurt by perceived abandonment, decides to apply for the scholarship
    
*   Upon the protagonist's return, a distance has formed between them
    
*   Mio has become Shion's primary confidant
    

#### Path B: Waiting Faithfully

*   Shion understands the protagonist's absence and waits for their return
    
*   The relationship remains strong but external pressures continue
    
*   Scholarship decision still looms, now with added emotional complications
    

#### Path C: Complicated Happiness

*   The protagonist and Shion begin a relationship, but the protagonist's family guilt creates tension
    
*   Their parent's condition becomes a hidden strain
    
*   The relationship becomes complicated by unspoken resentments
    

### Scene 21: Final Decision

As graduation approaches, final decisions must be made about the future:

**FINAL CHOICE POINT**: What path do the protagonist and Shion take?

#### Ending 1: Bittersweet Parting (Most "5cm" like)

*   Shion accepts the scholarship with the protagonist's blessing
    
*   They promise to maintain their connection despite distance
    
*   Final scene shows years passing with increasingly infrequent communication
    
*   Epilogue shows both living separate, somewhat fulfilled lives, occasionally wondering "what if"
    
*   Brief glimpse of an alternate timeline where they remained together
    

#### Ending 2: Sacrifice for Love

*   Shion declines the scholarship to remain close to the protagonist
    
*   Initial happiness gives way to occasional expressions of regret
    
*   Their relationship becomes tinged with "what might have been"
    
*   Epilogue shows them together but with underlying tensions about missed opportunities
    
*   Brief glimpse of an alternate timeline where Shion pursued their dreams
    

#### Ending 3: Compromise Path

*   Creative solution that allows partial pursuit of dreams while maintaining relationship
    
*   Requires significant sacrifices from both characters
    
*   Results in neither ideal career success nor perfect relationship
    
*   Epilogue shows realistic balance of fulfillment and regret
    
*   No alternate timeline shown – this is the best possible outcome given circumstances
    

Key Emotional Scenes
--------------------

### The Almost Confession

After building courage for weeks, the protagonist plans the perfect confession during the festival's fireworks display. The emergency call comes just minutes before the planned moment, creating devastation for the player who has been building toward this moment.

### The Glimpse Forward

Each ending includes a montage showing the next five years for both characters, emphasizing the "5 centimeters per second" theme of growing distance. These sequences create powerful emotional impact by showing how seemingly small decisions lead to vastly different life outcomes.

### The Constellation Promise

During a night spent in the observatory, Shion teaches the protagonist about a particular constellation only visible during a specific week each year. Together, they map its position and make a solemn promise to observe its return together the following year, no matter their circumstances. This astronomically-fixed date becomes a powerful emotional anchor throughout the story, with the constellation's brief annual appearance serving as a metaphor for their relationship's transience. Whether this astronomical promise is kept becomes a defining element in each ending.

### The Unsent Digital Message

In certain endings, the protagonist or Shion composes a heartfelt digital message – not a clichéd letter, but rather a carefully created digital artwork, music piece, or interactive experience that expresses what words cannot. The player witnesses its creation in exquisite detail, understanding its emotional significance and embedded meanings. However, at the critical moment of sending, technology fails (power outage during upload), courage wavers (finger hovering over the send button), or timing interferes (news arrives making the message irrelevant). The message remains forever in digital limbo – existing but never received. This modern take on missed communication creates powerful dramatic irony as the player alone knows what was almost shared.

### The Parallel Moment

Each ending includes a moment where both characters, now separated by circumstances or distance, unknowingly engage in the same activity at the same time (looking at the same stars, visiting similar places, etc.). This visual reinforces their connection despite separation.

Emotional Impact Analysis
-------------------------

The plot implements the emotional techniques outlined in the design document:

1.  **False Agency**: Player makes meaningful choices throughout, but external factors ultimately limit their impact.
    
2.  **Delayed Consequences**: Early choices about the scholarship have long-lasting implications that aren't immediately apparent.
    
3.  **Windows of Opportunity**: The festival confession represents a critical moment that can be permanently missed.
    
4.  **Knowledge Gaps**: Players make decisions without knowing about Mio's feelings or the severity of parent's condition.
    
5.  **Parallel Awareness**: Explicit "what could have been" glimpses show players the happiness that was possible but unattained.
    

The narrative creates the powerful emotional response of "I wish things had gone better for them" by establishing:

*   Genuinely good people deserving of happiness
    
*   Love that is real and reciprocated
    
*   Obstacles that are understandable and non-villainous
    
*   Multiple moments where happiness is nearly achieved
    
*   Explicit awareness of how close they came to a better outcome
